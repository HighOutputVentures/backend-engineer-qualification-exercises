# GUIDELINES

We have to prepare 5 coding problems which will be given to our backend developer candidates. When designing the problems, the following guidelines must be considered:

* Each problem must be solvable by a mid-level engineer within 1 hour.
* Each problem must be accompanied by a unit test.
* Each problem must represent actual problems that we solve at work.
